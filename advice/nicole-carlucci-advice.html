                <h4>Deciphering Mindset</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is like learning a completely new language, different from your native language and with a completely different system. Every obstacle is an opportunity and every aspect you don't understand is a challenge.</p>

                <p>Only when you get into the mechanics of the language, into the deciphering mindset, you can really understand it.</p>

                <h4>To want is to be able</h4>
                <p>In Italian there is a saying: "<span>Volere Ã¨ potere</span>" which in English can be translated as "To want is to be able" or literally "Will is power".</p>

                <p>I believe it's true. If you really want something, you can do it. Yes, maybe it takes longer, maybe the road is difficult and winding but, in the end, you make it.</p>

                <p>Only if you really want it.</p>

                <h4>And remember...</h4>
